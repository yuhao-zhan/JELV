        "S2-hyp": "As it is a genetic risk,the patient's next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform relatives is important so that necessary preventive actions can be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease, the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child. Hence by making your family members aware of the situation,it might lessen family pressure and suffering forcing you to settle down and have children.However, social ethical issues like discrimination and privacy are the biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforcing patients or doctors to disclose information to patients' relatives.These challenge confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996( HIPAA) in the United States,there is no legal requirement to disclose information to relatives; it is up to the patient's wish. .Early disclosement to family members brings in a positive reaction and facilitates prevention. As in the case of Angelina Jolie who chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I can still recall her reason for disclosing her own story; It was that she did not want to live under the shadow of cancer.",

        "S2-hyp": "As it is a genetic risk,the patient's next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform relatives is important so that necessary preventive actions can be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease, the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child. Hence by making your family members aware of the situation,it might lessen family pressure and suffering forcing you to settle down and have children.However, social ethical issues like discrimination and privacy are the biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients' relatives.These challenge confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996( HIPAA) in the United States,there is no legal requirement to disclose information to relatives; it is up to the patient's wish. .Early disclosement to family members brings in a positive reaction and facilitates prevention. As in the case of Angelina Jolie who chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I can still recall her reason for disclosing her own story; It was that she did not want to live under the shadow of cancer.",
